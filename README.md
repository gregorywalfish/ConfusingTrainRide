# ConfusingTrainRide
This assignment aims at building on what we have seen in assignment 1 to start storing information
and navigating it using complex data structures. Unlike in assignment 1, you will actually have to
make decisions on how you want to solve the problems at hand, and while we will see some methods
to tackle them in class, most of this discussion will be held at a conceptual level. Your task is to
translate your conceptual understanding of those concepts into Java. Watch out: the output of this
assignment is not deterministic, which means you can get different outcomes between executions.
Unlike for assignment 1, or for your assignments in COMP 202, it will not be immediately obvious
whether your code works. Make sure to think about this and test your program thoroughly! In
terms of specific concepts, this assignment tests all your knowledge on object-oriented programming
covered in A1, as well as doubly linked list, navigating between nodes on lists, rearranging lists,
and sorting.
